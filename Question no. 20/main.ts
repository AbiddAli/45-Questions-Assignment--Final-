// Q-20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


let languages: string [] = ["Arabic","English","Urdu","Chinese","German"];

console.log("List of Languages:");

for (let list of languages){console.log(list)};
