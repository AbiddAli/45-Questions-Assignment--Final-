// Q-14 Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guest_list = ["Ibrahim", "Ahmed", "Omar"];
guest_list.map(function (items) { return console.log("".concat(items, ", I would like to invite you on dinner tomorrow!")); });
